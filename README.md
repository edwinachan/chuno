# chuno

Chuno has been my first coding project aimed at teaching myself programming fundamentals.

How you play the game is largely identical to the real life Uno game: you win by getting rid of all your cards.

Load in the available files and have a go!

Note: the code within the file labelled 'chuno-automatic.js' plays through the game automatically if entered into Chrome's console.
